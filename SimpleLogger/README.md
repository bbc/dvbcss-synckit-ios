Simple wrapper macros/functions around ASL (Apple System
Log)

We support a compile-time log level through
MW_COMPILE_TIME_LOG_LEVEL. This will turn the associated log calls
into NOPs.

The log levels are the constants defined in asl.h:

```
#define ASL_LEVEL_EMERG   0
#define ASL_LEVEL_ALERT   1
#define ASL_LEVEL_CRIT    2
#define ASL_LEVEL_ERR     3
#define ASL_LEVEL_WARNING 4
#define ASL_LEVEL_NOTICE  5
#define ASL_LEVEL_INFO    6
#define ASL_LEVEL_DEBUG   7
```

For a description of when to use each level, see here:
http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/LoggingErrorsAndWarnings.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000172i-SW8-SW1

* **Emergency** (level 0) - The highest priority, usually reserved for
catastrophic failures and reboot notices.
* **Alert** (level 1)     - A serious failure in a key system.
* **Critical** (level 2)  - A failure in a key system.
* **Error** (level 3)     - Something has failed.
* **Warning** (level 4)   - Something is amiss and might fail if not corrected.
* **Notice** (level 5)    - Things of moderate interest to the user or administrator.
* **Info** (level 6)      - The lowest priority that you would normally log, and purely informational in nature.
* **Debug** (level 7)     - The lowest priority, and normally not logged except for messages from the kernel.


Note that by default the iOS syslog/console will only record items up to level ASL_LEVEL_NOTICE.
