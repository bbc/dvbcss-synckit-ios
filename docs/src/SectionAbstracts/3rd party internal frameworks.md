These frameworks are 3rd party frameworks that are used internally by *dvbcss-synckit-ios*
and are included in the repository and Xcode workspace. 

An application using *dvbcss-synckit-ios* frameworks is not expected to need to
directly use these frameworks, however they are documented here in case they are
helpful.

See the documentation for each framework for details of the original authorship
and licence terms for that framework.
