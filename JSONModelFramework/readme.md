# JSONModelFramework

A library to that allows a data model to be built to facilitate serialising Objective C objects into JSON and deserialise JSON back to Objective C.

This project is a repackaging of the excellent [JSONModel library](https://github.com/jsonmodel/jsonmodel) as a dynamic library (an iOS framework). It complies with v1.02 of the JSONModel library.

It is intended for internal use only. Please refer to the original [JSONModel library](https://github.com/jsonmodel/jsonmodel) for a more recent version.
