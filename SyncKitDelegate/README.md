# SyncKitConfiguration Framework

An optional configurator component whose role is to load all components required to enable
TV discovery, wallclock synchronisation, content identification and timeline synchronisation.
This component also keeps track of the current TV device being synchronised to and other user-selected
artifacts.

**WARNING:** this component has now been deprecated but is still included as it is used in some demo applications.
